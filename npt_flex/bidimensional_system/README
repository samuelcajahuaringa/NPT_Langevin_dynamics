A fortran implementation of the NPT langevin dynamics with anisotropic volume fluctuations
for a bidimensional systems that display solid-solid phase transition.
The algorithm is described in the following paper:
Stochastic sampling of the isothermal-isobaric ensemble: phase diagram of crystalline solids 
created a executable md_2d.x by compile the script md_2d.sh
./md_2d.sh

run a simulation 
./md_2d.x < infile

the parameter of the infile are
temperature 0.462 0.462      <- temperature start and stop
tstep 0.01                   <- time step
Tp 0.5                       <- relaxation time of langenvin thermostat apply to the particles velocities
pressure 0.0 0.0             <- external pressure start and stop
Tb 5.0                       <- relaxation time of langenvin thermostat apply to the barostat velocities
ensemble npt                 <- select the ensemble options: nve, nvt and npt
npt_style flex               <- style of the npt ensemble iso and flex (default iso)
forcecutoff 3.0              <- cutoff distance of pair potential
listcutoff  3.2              <- cutoff distance of neighbor list 
nequil  10000                <- numbers of steps until equilibrate the system
nstep  100000                <- numbers of steps the production
