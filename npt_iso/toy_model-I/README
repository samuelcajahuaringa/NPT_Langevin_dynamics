A fortran implementation of the NPT langevin dynamics for a single partile in one dimensional potential is provided. 
The algorithm is described in the following paper:
Stochastic sampling of the isothermal-isobaric ensemble: phase diagram of crystalline solids 
created a executable npt.x by compile the script npt.sh
./npt.sh

run a simulation 
./npt.x < infile

the parameter of the infile are
nrun 1000          <- numbers of steps to pre-equilibration system
nequil 80000       <- numbers of steps to equilibration system
nstat 1000         <- print each steps    
dt 0.01            <- time step
xi 2.0             <- initial position 
pi 0.0             <- initial momentum
mi 1.0             <- mass 
Li 8.0             <- initial length box
ve 0.0             <- initial velocity box
kT 1.0             <- temperature
Tp 1.0             <- characteristic time scale of the particle
Tb 3.0             <- characteristic time scale of the barostat 
Pext 1.0           <- external pressure
seed 23            <- seed
