A fortran implementation of the NPT langevin dynamics for a one dimensional problem is provided. 
The algorithm is described in the following paper:
Stochastic sampling of the isothermal-isobaric ensemble: phase diagram of crystalline solids 
created a executable npt.x by compile the script npt.sh
./npt.sh

run a simulation 
./npt.x < infile

the parameter of the infile are
