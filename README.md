<TITLE> Stochastic sampling of the isothermal-isobaric ensemble with Langevin dynamics
</HEAD>
We provide the code that supports the numerical tests reported in the manuscript Stochastic sampling of the isothermal-isobaric
ensemble: phase diagram of crystalline solids from Langevin dynamics simulation 

This is a fortran codes for performing simulations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble with isotropic volume fluctuations for two toys models
and also the fully flexible cell case for a bidimensional model that display a solid-solid phase transition.

Requirements

    Fortran

Usage

The examples are founds in the folders npt_iso and npt_flex with respective README files to explain how use the codes.
